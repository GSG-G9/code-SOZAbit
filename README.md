# code-SOZAbit
this is a portfolio for our 4 members: Alaa Shurrab, Osama Al-Attar, Sondos Al-Alami, and Zein Jendeya.

the website starts with a home page with our logo and team name int it, it has 3 buttons to scroll through the page
then About us page with a brief discription about our team
last but not least a form to contact us

at fisrt we designed the entire using Figma, then we chose a name for our team Code SOZAbit (it's a pun)
then we started working on the first html parts of the page adding everything by order
after every html section we added we wrote the css lines needed to style it
later we started working on making the webpage responsive to fit with different devices


if we had more time we would have changed the color of the page and added some more animation to our page.
we would've added a footer and worked more on positioning items.
